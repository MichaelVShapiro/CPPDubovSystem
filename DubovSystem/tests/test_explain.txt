# Explanation of Pairings

## Step 1

CPPDubovSystem (https://github.com/MichaelVShapiro/CPPDubovSystem) -- Explanation of pairings.

## Step 2

Sort players into respective score groups (sorted by points then by pairing number)

## Step 3

Computing due colors, due color strengths, and ARO for all players.

## Step 4

Odd number of players in the tournament! Picking the player who should get the BYE by following rule 3.1...

## Step 5

Trying to give player BYE: Player2 (ID = 2)

## Step 6

Attempting to pair tournament...

## Step 7

Doing pairings for score group with points: 3.500000

## Step 8

Split players into groups. Those who have the due color White go into the "White Seekers" Group while those who are due Black go into the "Black Seekers" Group.

## Step 9

Black Seekers (sorted by pairing number)
1. Player5 (ID = 5) -- Points = 3.500000 -- ARO = 1400.000000 -- Rating = 1209 -- Due Color: Black -- Due Color Strength: Alternation

## Step 10

### Score Group View

|White Seekers|Black Seekers   |
|             |Player5 (ID = 5)|

## Step 11

Group has an odd number of players! Attempting to pick an upfloater...

## Step 12

Possible upfloaters (properly sorted by the following: score differences amongst players minimized, players closer to the top of the list are not max upfloaters or upfloated previously, and have the proper due color that would go to the group of seekers with less players).
1. Player3 (ID = 3) -- Points = 2.500000 -- ARO = 1298.000000 -- Rating = 1419 -- Due Color: White -- Due Color Strength: Alternation
2. Player4 (ID = 4) -- Points = 2.000000 -- ARO = 1512.000000 -- Rating = 1238 -- Due Color: White -- Due Color Strength: Mild
3. Player7 (ID = 7) -- Points = 2.000000 -- ARO = 1638.000000 -- Rating = 1038 -- Due Color: White -- Due Color Strength: Absolute
4. Player1 (ID = 1) -- Points = 2.000000 -- ARO = 1393.000000 -- Rating = 2285 -- Due Color: Black -- Due Color Strength: Mild
5. Player6 (ID = 6) -- Points = 2.000000 -- ARO = 1520.000000 -- Rating = 1043 -- Due Color: Black -- Due Color Strength: Absolute

## Step 13

Picking the next upfloater on the list of upfloaters to try on the list: player with ID = 3, Name = Player3

## Step 14

Removing upfloater from lower score group...

## Step 15

Upfloater has the due color White. Inserting this player into White Seekers and resorting this group again...

## Step 16

Group after inserting upfloater and sorting by ARO...
1. Player3 (ID = 3) -- Points = 2.500000 -- ARO = 1298.000000 -- Rating = 1419 -- Due Color: White -- Due Color Strength: Alternation

|Player3 (ARO = 1298.000000, ID = 3)|Player5 (ID = 5)|

## Step 18

White Seekers and Black Seekers groups are of even size. Attempting to pair them as follows: 1st player in White Seekers plays 1st player in Black Seekers, 2nd player in White Seekers plays 2nd player in Black Seekers, etc.

## Step 19

Player3 (ID = 3) (white) vs. Player5 (ID = 5) - Pairing incompatible!

## Step 20

Problem exists in pairing! Attempting to fix it using transpositions (rule 4.4)...

## Step 21

No good transpositions available!

## Step 22

Attempting to move shifters (swap players between White Seekers and Black Seekers until we could get a pairing working) following rule 4.3.

## Step 23

### Score Group View After Inserting Upfloater

|White Seekers|Black Seekers   |
|             |Player1 (ID = 1)|
|             |Player5 (ID = 5)|

## Step 57

White Seekers group (0 players), Black Seekers group (2 players) are not the same size! Attempting to find optimal shifters to move (hopefully moving from the bigger group to the smaller, but if this is impossible, we will move some from both groups until the group can be paired). The players to be chosen to be moved from the larger group to the smaller group will be chosen as described in rule 4.3.3

## Step 58

Generating order of shifters to move...

## Step 59

Larger group has an even number of players. We pick the players to move as follows: take the middle player. The player to the left of this player as the largest priority to move, the middle player has the second priority to move, the player to the left of the left player has the third priority to move, the player to the right of the middle player has the fourth priority to move, etc.

## Step 60


1. Player1 (ID = 1)
2. Player5 (ID = 5)

## Step 61

Smaller group has an even number of players. We pick the players to move as follows: take the middle player. The player to the left of this player as the largest priority to move, the middle player has the second priority to move, the player to the left of the left player has the third priority to move, the player to the right of the middle player has the fourth priority to move, etc.

## Step 62



## Step 63

Move priorities all set up. First, try moving players from the larger group (given their move priority) to the smaller. If this cannot be accomplished, there is a chance that some players from the smaller group have to also be moved. But avoid this from happening.

## Step 64

Shifter found! Shifting Player1 (ID = 1) from Black Seekers to White Seekers.

## Step 65

Sorting White Seekers and Black Seekers again...

## Step 66

White Seekers after sorting by ARO:
1. Player1 (ID = 1) -- Points = 2.000000 -- ARO = 1393.000000 -- Rating = 2285 -- Due Color: Black -- Due Color Strength: Mild

## Step 67

Player5 (ID = 5) (white) - Player1(ID = 1)

## Step 75

Pairing for group completed successfully!

## Step 76

Attempting to pair next group...

## Step 77

Doing pairings for score group with points: 2.500000

## Step 78

Split players into groups. Those who have the due color White go into the "White Seekers" Group while those who are due Black go into the "Black Seekers" Group.

## Step 79
